**24.05** I am interested in extracting features from videos, removing unnecessary parts, and creating new images with only the features remaining. Like applying a high-dimensional chroma key to extract only the necessary parts from a 3D image.
Additionally, I am interested in the field of image reconstruction and feature extraction after removing noise.
Currently, I am planning a project that uses an autoencoder to remove unnecessary noise from driving images and reconstruct only important data such as lanes and surrounding objects.


**ComputerVision**에 관심 있고 **self-driving** 분야를 연구하고 있습니다.

I am interested in **extracting features from images**, removing unnecessary parts, and creating new images with only the features remaining. Like applying a high-dimensional chroma key to extract only the necessary parts from a 3D image.

Additionally, I am interested in the field of **image reconstruction and feature extraction** after removing noise.

Currently, I am planning a project that uses an variational autoencoder to remove unnecessary noise from driving images and reconstruct only important data such as lanes and surrounding objects.
